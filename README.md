# Security-and-Privacy-Resources-using-Distributed-Programming
This project presents a secure server-client architecture designed to enhance the security and privacy of valuable resources within a networked environment. The architecture employs a multithreaded server, accommodating multiple clients and facilitating secure communication channels. The server is equipped with mechanisms for authenticating a designated master node, responsible for managing resource access requests.

Steps:
1. Copy paste the server and client code on two different windows of the visual studio (make sure u have installed c# compiler).
2. Run the server code.
3. Run the client code.
4. Follow the step by step (line by line) instruction as mentioned in the output section.
5. You can have new nodes (clients) using the new instance.
